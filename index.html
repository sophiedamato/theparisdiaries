                  The beginning of my journey was tumultuous. Arriving on a saturday morning without the ability to move into my apartment for 48 hours was a destabilizing start– a very french one. Just a short 24 hours after my arrival, Ashley arrived. We had a short and sweet little moment together. I vividly remember meeting her in the park around the corner from Reid Hall– we caught up like we hadn’t just seen each other a week ago in our apartment and savored cappuccinos at the terrace in the Luxembourg Gardens. While the nuance of a new, romantic city with unfamiliar faces, arduous classes and city lifestyle also came with a sense of lacking in preparation– materially, academically, emotionally. </p>
                <p style="padding-right: 40px; padding-top:20px">
                  As much as I was enthusiastic to finally be in the environment where I anticipated a stark learning curve to my life as an American student, I was dragged by the first weeks in Paris. The lingerings of new, blossoming relationships I left in Evanston felt heavy and inconclusive…. I was unable and unwilling to put my American (NU) life on hold after having done so once before… for 18 months.

                Excited to explore my new home, I was eager to discover the local cafés, boulangeries, and parks, but hardly anticipated what my adjustment would entail on the logistical front. A lot of the time I felt alone, and when not alone, a bit misunderstood and out of place. Most mornings I woke up, ran around my neighborhood, across the bridge outside la bibliothèque Francois-Mitterand, and wove my way back home. I made friendly acquaintances with my classmates and found my classwork at Reid Hall to be meaningful and immersive, attending theater performances, historical tours, and movies for field trips. The Reid Hall ‘campus’ is set in the Montparnasse neighborhood, notable for its lively energy for an apéro or for its grand boulevards from the Haussman period– a place to make one easily overwhelmed. 
              </p>
              <p style="padding-bottom:20px">At the end of June, I met up with Emma for an apértivo in the 9th. We met at the Sacre Coeur under the cascading steps like characters from a hallmark rom-com. We stopped at a quaint spot around the corner from the Place de Saint George, which funny enough, is where my second apartment would be just a short few months later. I vividly remember how grounding and at peace her presence and conversation over tapas made me feel and how badly I didn’t want her to leave.

                  The first weekend of July, Stephanie, Selma, and I visited Stephanie’s family in Geneva. On the way to Geneva, we stopped in Lyon for a day tour of the quiet city with other Columbia students. Finding comfort in the calmness of the ancient city, I found myself more at peace than I had since arriving in France. The warm hospitality of Stephanie’s family made for a homey weekend of relaxation and fresh air. As we rode in the backseats of the family VW bug convertible, the cool lake breeze reminded me of that back home off of Lake Michigan— the sense of ease was unparalleled. 
                 </p>
                <p style="color: aliceblue; padding: 0px;"> 
                  As much as the aperol spritzes and pain au chocolats offered a comforting escape to the parisian dream, the homesickness still prevailed. Sarah came from Florence to visit for her birthday– the same weekend of La Fête de la Bastille, the 14th of July. Before having spent the entire weekend together in my tiny studio, Sarah and I weren’t particularly close friends. Looking back as we’re now much closer, it's endearing that from my journal entry after her visit, I can tell she brought me a sense of nonchalance and a renaissance in romanticizing the charming city. Roaming the streets together, she helped me put words to my sense of lostness and helped me critically think about my intentions for the coming fall semester. We gawked at the Musée de L’Orangerie, perused the books in Shakespeare and Co., and passed hours strolling through the Marais and République neighborhoods.
                 </p>
                <p style="color: aliceblue; padding: 0px;"> 
                  Filled with more constructive reflection and acceptance of my struggle, my July boded well for my journey with my personal growth– instead of fretting about the amazement of my own homesickness, I started to approach the unsettled feeling with acceptance and compassion. The last weekend of July, Carly came from her Prague program for a visit on her way back to the states. Her expressions of awe at the parisian architecture, food, and museums again gave me such a novel appreciation for what had become my familiar routine. I finished up classes, packed my bags, and headed to Dubrovnik, Croatia.

                <p class="section-description">My reunion with Noel in Dubruvnik immediately provoked the turning of a new chapter. I was ready for more sun, more familiar comfort, and more english. I remember the fews first days of our trip in Dubrovnik being untainted with any distraction or heaviness– we were back to being just us two basking in the sun on the hidden cement platforms without possession of a working cellular device, consuming ungodly amounts of fruit, and reading to our hearts’ content– all while watching the pristine, aquamarine waves below. In a way, reuniting with Noel was the resesitating breath I needed to reawaken my own consciousness.

            <p class="cta-text"> Adjusting to my new schedule of classes at IFE, I found myself more confident spending alone time in the city and speaking with acquaintances at local shops and boulangeries. The beginning of the fall semester brought a wave of new energy, neighborhood, and routine. From observing the initial shock experienced by my classmates, I felt validated in my summer-long identity crisis. Not only did the city feel 1000 times more approachable, but having the camaraderie of other NU students (including Jasmine and Angela!) gave me a sense of mutual understanding and community that had been lacking in the summer months. 
            </p>
            <p class="cta-text">
              For Jasmine’s birthday, we headed to Cassis, the quaintest most quintessential southern france beachtown of all time. We enjoyed leisurely brunches, hiked the Calanques, and basked in the dwindling Mediterranean sun and ate……more fruit, of course.   </p>
            <p class="cta-text">
              By now, Place des Vosges felt familiar– though never not spectacular– and my google maps’ saved spots were beginning to look like I knew a thing or two about the city… :) 
            </p>
            <p style="color: aliceblue;" class="cta-text">
              After IFE finals, I planned a week-long solo trip, first to Munich for Oktoberfest with Miranda, then to Salzburg for a week of solitude and promenading, and finally to Florence via train across the Alps to meet up with Nick. I will never forget my time in Salzburg. Immediately charmed by the cobblestone streets and cozy residential neighborhood where my hostel was, I was able to fully take advantage of the sights of the city and figure out the public transportation enough to do some crazy hikes across the German border (with just a little help from hitchhiking). All in all– damn I’m good at spending time alone.

              The changing of the seasons in Paris is definitely my favorite time to be in the city. While my placement at the Musée en Herbe was not a highlight of the first few weeks of October, the commute back to La Vigie along the Seine was. Glowing in the golden-hour sunlight, the brilliant yellow leaves of the perfectly-aligned trees fluttered in the wind and savored their last days of life.    </p>
            <p>
              The switching of my stage to work with Elsa was probably the best blessing in disguise of all. I like to think my cutting of scrap paper for eight hours a day at the museum paid for the realized dream that was our fall vacance in La Roche Guyon. Tucked discreetly on the Seine, her atelier à la campagne was too quaint for even me to fathom. Spending our evenings with her ‘amant’, Matthieau, and his family in their ‘chateau’, we quickly cleaned up our work stations of the day and loaded into the car. We spent our commute learning more about each other– still nearly strangers–  and bonded in her tiny car over the rolling hills as we listened to her Jay-Z CD. 
            </p>

            <p>
              At the end of October, Jasmine, Angela, Tanya and I took a last-minute weekend trip to Bordeaux. Situated on a large but quiet street, our airbnb was on the third-floor of a stunning, picturesque home. We all shared incredible meals together in this quaint city, and it surprised us all how much more relaxed we felt with a little sun, warmer breeze and less traffic. I’ll always remember the last morning Jasmine and I spent together–waking up early, walking into town, enjoying an espresso while listening to a man play his guitar next to a stone fountain. We went to a coffee shop, got our espresso, and split a slice of homemade carrot cake, with delight.

                Growing closer with Elsa’s daughters, Ester and Dora, their apartment, where I worked most days, felt like the safe haven I had longed for since my jet-lagged weeks in summer. Offering warm lentils, fresh greens from the farmer’s market, and a cup of espresso, Elsa would prepare lunch for the two of us. One afternoon, instead of meeting at the atelier or her apartment, we went to visit an elderly ceramist at her home in the 17th. Interacting with another ceramist, we discussed my thesis and the theory of les savoir-faires. I distinctly remember us leaving the apartment and rushing to Sèvres, the renowned porcelain factory and museum just before closing time. 
  </p>
  <p style="color: aliceblue;">
    For a quick weekend, I headed across the English Channel to London to meet up with Miranda. Sunny the morning after my late arrival, London was glowing in the morning sun– I was pleasantly surprised and immediately in love. We spent the weekend together, covering as much ground of the massive city as possible– from the City of London, to Hyde park, to Hackney, Borough Market and South Bank, we may have hit record numbers for steps in a weekend. 
  </p>
              <p style="color: aliceblue;">
                At the end of November, my final weeks were met with a tender visit from family. Enjoying meals at my wishlist-spots, and showing them around my neighborhood and favorite areas, their visit made me reflect on how familiar Paris had become and how my language struggle and constant practice had truly paid off. Walking from l’Île de Saint-Louis to l’Épicerie, mom, Sam, and I bantered about my time here and my return back to Evanston, something that I was shamelessly looking forward to. We stopped at a bar, savored an espresso martini, and met up with Paul for dinner at his favorite traditional bistro. 
 </p>
                <p style="color: aliceblue;">
                  Looking back, it is hard to comprehend how fast six months come and go and are gone. I look back with compassion for myself and my struggle, but feel pride and humility in the person I have become since my time there. I’m timid to imagine any situation in which I will live in Paris again long-term, but at the same time, I feel I owe it to myself to go back with already having learned the lessons it taught me.
